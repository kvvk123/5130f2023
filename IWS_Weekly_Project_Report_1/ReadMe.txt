Week 1 progress:

The HTML code creates a front-end for an expense tracker web app called "Coin Count." It provides a user-friendly interface for managing expenses, including a welcoming description, login and signup buttons, and a form for entering expenses. The app dynamically updates an expense list and total without page reloads, using JavaScript. CSS styling ensures a modern look, and media queries make it responsive. However, data storage and authentication require additional back-end development.
