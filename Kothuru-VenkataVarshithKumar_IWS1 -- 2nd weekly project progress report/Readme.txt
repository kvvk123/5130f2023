Project Name: Coin count

Project concept : 

The core concept behind our Coincount website is to deliver a user-friendly and all-encompassing financial management solution for individuals and small businesses. This project is driven by the goal of streamlining the process of tracking expenses and income, providing valuable insights through an interactive dashboard, and fostering financial awareness. Our platform empowers users to easily record and categorize their expenses, monitor various sources of income, and receive timely reminders for important events like credit card APR due dates. Our ultimate objective is to encourage effective financial management, alleviate financial stress, and assist users in reaching their financial objectives


Week 2 progress :

In the second week of development at Coin count, we made a considerable progress in refining user interaction and navigational aspects of the platform. This involved integrating a 'Get Started' button on the Landing Page for a smoother transition to login and sign-up interfaces, and there are three navigation buttons Insights, Features, and About each opening into detailed, interconnected sections of the page and the implementation of an intuitive and interlinked page design which tells us about a wide array of functionalities to an in-depth exploration of Coin countâ€™s mission and core values, which are made for an cohesive user experience.


Upcoming progress:

In the next phase of implementation we are introducing a robust user authentication system, designed to enhance security and ensure secure access for our users. This advanced login mechanism will not only authenticate user identities but also pave the way for the introduction of a personalized dashboard. The dashboard, a key feature in our development roadmap, will offer users a tailored interface for managing and interacting with their Coin count account.
