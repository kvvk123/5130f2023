Project concept : 

The core concept behind our Coincount website is to deliver a user-friendly and all-encompassing financial management solution for individuals and small businesses. This project is driven by the goal of streamlining the process of tracking expenses and income, providing valuable insights through an interactive dashboard, and fostering financial awareness. Our platform empowers users to easily record and categorize their expenses, monitor various sources of income, and receive timely reminders for important events like credit card APR due dates. Our ultimate objective is to encourage effective financial management, alleviate financial stress, and assist users in reaching their financial objectives


Last week progress:-

AS of our Last week progress , We created our webpage of cointcount with good userfreindly UI which has buttons such as Insight, Features, and About  which tells about the product and quality of product and also there is a button "Get Started " the page displays a Login/Signup section without the user functionalities given and also no user authentication.



Week3 Progress :-

During this week's work, we established a connection with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) to utilize cloud-based servers. We set up an instance named MySQL, configuring and installing necessary components through the local terminal.Running Apache and MySQL, we obtained an IP address and linked our website files to the server via the local terminal. As a result, our website is now hosted on a cloud-based server and is prepared to store data in the database.Upon accessing the IP address, the website, designed in week 2, is displayed. The Login/Signup feature has been implemented with functionalities such that when a user signs up, their data gets stored in the database, and a confirmation pop-up titled "Form submitted" appears. Subsequently, upon successful login, a message saying "Successfully Logged in" pops up, marking the completion of user authentication.Once a user logs in successfully, a user profile is generated, and the Dashboard page is shown. However, the specifics of layouts, CSS, and additional functionalities are slated for discussion in the progress reports of upcoming weeks.


Note:- project is runned using an Ec2 instance from Aws and we can't run these server continuos because as for the basic trails it allows only 750 hrs and if crosses more than that there is a charge for that so for running and testing we started and stopped after work done and if we run the ip address in the db.php it shows error because it is not connected to server and instance for this reason to show our outputs we are attaching screenshots of work done.
